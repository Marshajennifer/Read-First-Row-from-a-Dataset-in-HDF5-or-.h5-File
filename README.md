# Read-First-Row-from-a-Dataset-in-HDF5-or-.h5-File

This Python script demonstrates how to open an HDF5 file and read the first row from a specified dataset. It utilizes the h5py library to handle HDF5 files, which are commonly used for storing large datasets in a hierarchical format. This script is especially useful for data scientists and researchers working with large and complex datasets, providing a quick way to inspect the initial data entries without loading the entire dataset into memory. It also includes basic error handling to ensure the dataset exists before attempting to access it.

Make sure to replace 'train.h5' and 'part' with the actual file name and dataset you wish to inspect.
This script can be easily modified to fetch any row by changing the index 0 to the desired row number.

I have used .h5 file of MPII dataset here.
